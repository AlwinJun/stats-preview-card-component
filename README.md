# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a project solution for the [Stats preview card component challenge at FEM newbie level](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62)

I'm not a FEM pro account user so I don't have acces to the Figma design. But i still tried to develop it base on the jpeg file at the design folder.
